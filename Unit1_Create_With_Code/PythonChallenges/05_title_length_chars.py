# REVIEW from last lesson
# STEP 1 - Write an algorithm that solves the problem as a human - test to make sure it works
# STEP 2 - Think about how a computer might read the algorithm -
#       * do you need to save data to variables?
#       * do you know any built in functions that might help you?
# STEP 3 - Write the program by following the algorithm step by step - test to make sure it works
# STEP 4 - Are there any functions you could add to make the program more efficient?
# STEP 5 - Consider useability principles - can you make your program -
#       * ACCESSIBILITY - The ability to be used by many different people, including people with disabilities -> provide clear instructions and feedback
#       * SAFETY - The ability for users to make errors
#       * EFFECTIVENESS & UTILITY - can you add any additional features or functions for the user
#       * LEARNABILITY - is your solution consistent and easy to learn?

# Algorithm - step by step instructions
# Announce purpose of program
# Ask user for title of book
# Count characters in title
# Output result
