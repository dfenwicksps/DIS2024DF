# BOOK TITLE LENGTH
# Write a program that asks the user for the title of a book
# Return the length of the title
# Extension - can you count the number of words in a title
# Extension: respond to the user if you think the title is
# too short or too long

# Start with an algorithm - how would you solve this problem?
# In groups of 3 - one person is the computer, one person
#  is the user and one person observing and
# writing down step by step, exactly what happens
# Now what Python methods/functions might you need to know?


# CAPITAL INDEXES
Write a function named capital_indexes.
The function takes a single parameter, which is a string.
Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters.

For example, calling capital_indexes("HeLlO") should return the list [0, 2, 4].

Middle letter
Write a function named mid that takes a string as its parameter.
Your function should extract and return the middle letter.
If there is no middle letter, your function should return the empty string.

For example, mid("abc") should return "b" and mid("aaaa") should return "".
